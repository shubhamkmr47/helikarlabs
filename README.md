##Technology Overview

Boolean networks have become a popular mathematical framework to study the dynamics of biological and biochemical systems. The framework was developed by Stuart Kauffman in 1969 and Rene Thomas in 1973. They as well as many other researchers have developed many analytical methods to analyze the dynamics of biological processes (such as gene regulation) described as Boolean networks. Unfortunately these powerful methods and tools implementing them are limited to those trained in computer science or mathematics. 

The goal of this project is to transform the way analysis of Boolean networks is done by bringing it to the web and in a easy-to-use, data-driven, and graphical manner so that anyone, including biomedical researchers not trained in mathematics/CS, can utilize these powerful tools. Specifically, we are looking to build a javascript/Java component that implements algorithms for and visualizes the results of the following analytical tools: 

State Transition Graphs, Attractor/Steady state analysis, Boolean Function Analysis (e.g., degree of canalization, sensitivity), Connectivity Matrix, Graph/network properties (e.g., connectivity, path length)
